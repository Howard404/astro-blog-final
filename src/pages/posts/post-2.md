One framework that is often viewed as a easier alternative to React is the framework Vue.js. So, what is Vue JS, and why do some consider Vue over React?

# What is Vue?

Vue is a a javascript framework best known for its declarative rendering and reactivity. When we say declarative rendering, we mean that the javascript data (or state) can be easily refected onto the DOM using HTML. Reactivity means Vue is automatically checking javascript state, updating the DOM whenever the state were to change/update. These two aspects alone greatly improves the developer experience in comparision to React where state is updated to the DOM manually. Also, Vue is built for optimization, which means Vue projects are known for their ability to scale.

# Is Vue really better than React?

The short answer here is yes and no. Vue does a huge improvement over React in its ability to scale and its overall simplicity. However, React is a more mature library with a larger set of documentation and a larger community. There are also more resources for third party components with React compared to Vue as well. Nonetheless, Vue is still a great choice when deciding what front-end technology to use on your next web project.
