How can a library that was incredibly disliked by the front-end community become one of the industry standards of our day? What is React anyways? In this Article we answer just that.

## What is React?

In short, React is a component based library known for creating declaritive and interactive user interfaces. When exploring a React project, you will notice that each part of the UI is rendered in modular componentized fashion. If a user were to interact with the UI causing a change, the whole page renders opposed to the old method of rendering individual UI components with vanilla JS.

Of course, rendering individual UI elements is not a bad method, epecially for smaller web projects. However, once a web page grows and more interactive elements are introduced, managing this can be cumbersum. This is why Facebook took a leap of faith being the contrarians to the industry standard for that day.
